**Typoueb**

A tool to help the orthotypo geeks rule the internet.

In this small page you can find the html reference, the numerical reference, the unicode and the english name, of some of the most useful typographical signs.

So far, the classification relies on the [unicode](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) classification, but it might be improved.
Feel free to fork, and to add your own typographical signs if you think they are useful.
